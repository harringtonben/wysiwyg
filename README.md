# WYSIWYG

### (What You See Is What You Get)

> This App will do the following:

* Print an array to the page in the form of biography cards
* Allow the user to click on each card, which will add a dotted border around the card that was selected
* Once a card is clicked, It will bring focus to the text input on the page, and allow the user to type in the text input and replace the bio of the selected person.
* If you hit the enter key while typing, it will clear the input field.

> And what you get is a full functioning webpage that allows you to change the bios of important figures from Star Wars.
